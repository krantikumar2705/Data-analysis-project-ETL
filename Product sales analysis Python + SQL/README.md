# ETL and Data Analysis Project

This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and data analysis using Python and SQL. The goal of the project is to process raw data, transform it into a usable format, and perform analysis to extract meaningful insights. It uses Python for data processing and SQL for querying data from a relational database.

## Overview
![PROject](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4549054c-9b84-402c-99ed-856be54747ec)

This project involves the following steps:

1. **ETL Pipeline**: Extracts data from a source (e.g., a database or CSV files), transforms it to fit the analysis requirements, and loads it into a destination (such as a database or data warehouse).
2. **SQL Data Extraction**: Uses SQL queries to manipulate, aggregate, and analyze data stored in a relational database.
3. **Data Analysis**: Python is used for data manipulation, transformation, and visualization. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are used for analysis and plotting results.

### Features

- **ETL**: Data extraction from different sources, transformation with Python, and loading into databases.
- **Data Analysis**: Performs data aggregation, cleaning, and analysis using SQL and Python.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphs and plots to visualize key metrics.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing, transformation, and analysis.
  - Libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `SQLAlchemy`, `Matplotlib`
- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing data in the database.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data exploration and analysis.
- **Database**: The project assumes the use of a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- A relational database (e.g., MySQL)
- A database client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin) for interacting with your database
