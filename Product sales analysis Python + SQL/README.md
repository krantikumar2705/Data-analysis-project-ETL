# ETL and Data Analysis Project with Kaggle API Integration

This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that includes data extraction from Kaggle using the Kaggle API, transforming the data using Python, and loading it into a relational SQL database for analysis. The goal is to fetch datasets from Kaggle, process them, and perform SQL-based data analysis and visualization.
## Overview

This project covers the following steps:

1. **Extract**: Fetch data from Kaggle using the Kaggle API.
2. **Transform**: Clean and preprocess the data using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
3. **Load**: Store the transformed data into a SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
4. **Data Analysis**: Perform data analysis and generate insights using SQL queries and Python-based visualization libraries.

### Features

- **Kaggle API Integration**: Fetch datasets directly from Kaggle.
- **ETL**: Data extraction, transformation, and loading into a database.
- **SQL Data Extraction**: Use SQL queries to perform data analysis and aggregation.
- **Data Visualization**: Use Python's Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing key metrics.

## Project Structure



## Overview
![PROject](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4549054c-9b84-402c-99ed-856be54747ec)

This project involves the following steps:.
**SQL Data Extraction**: Uses SQL queries to manipulate, aggregate, and analyze data stored in a relational database.
**Data Analysis**: Python is used for data manipulation, transformation, and visualization. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are used for analysis and plotting results.

### Features

- **ETL**: Data extraction from different sources, transformation with Python, and loading into databases.
- **Data Analysis**: Performs data aggregation, cleaning, and analysis using SQL and Python.
- **Visualization**: Generates graphs and plots to visualize key metrics.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing, transformation, and analysis.
  - Libraries: `Pandas`, `SQLAlchemy`,`kaggle`,`zipfile`
- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing data in the database.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data exploration and analysis.
- **Database**: The project assumes the use of a relational database (e.g., MySQL).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- A relational database (e.g., MySQL)
- A database client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin) for interacting with your database
